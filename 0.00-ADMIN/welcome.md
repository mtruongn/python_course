# Welcome to DSI-4

In this program, you’ll take on real world problems by analyzing data sets for insights and presenting findings using statistics, programming, data modeling, and business knowledge.

This course is designed to give you a deep dive into the world of *Data Science*, focusing on the ability to analyze and convey data-driven insights using modeling and machine learning. Our course prepares students to take full-time roles as Data Analysis, Data Scientists, Business Intelligence Analysts, and other roles that require advanced fluency with data. 

###What You'll Learn as A Student

- **Data Analysis & Python**: Perform visual and statistical analysis on data using Python and its associated libraries and tools.
- **Machine Learning & Modeling Techniques**: Explore the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning through the application of various modeling techniques such as classification, regression, and clustering.
- **Git, SQL, & Relational Databases**: Gather, store, and organize your data using the data science toolkit: SQL, Git, and UNIX.
- **Critical Thinking & Synthesis**: Apply your analysis and modeling skills to real world data problems in fields like finance, marketing, and public policy.
- **Visualization, Presentation & Reporting**: Learn to create reproducible presentations and reports and use data visualisation tools to present your findings to key stakeholders.

# Graduation Requirements

As data scientists, you will be expected to have many skills developed. Employers are looking for candidates who:

- Demonstrate technical proficiency from defining the business problem and gathering data to building and evaluating models.
- Confidently speak in depth about the technical choices made.
- Communicate competently to non-technical audiences.
- Write clearly and about the work they do.
- Recognize how their work impacts real-world decisions and stakeholders.

It's not enough to simply develop these skills; you also have to **show employers** that you've mastered these skills!

At General Assembly, we'll spend the next twelve weeks working with you to develop these skills and showcase them to a variety of audiences.

*In order to graduate from the Data Science Immersive program with General Assembly and receive your certificate of completion, by stated deadlines you must*:

- Meet all attendance requirements.
- Satisfactorily complete 80% of all homework assignments, consisting of labs, blog posts, and assessments.
- Satisfactorily complete all projects.
- Pay your tuition in full.

### Attendance

While attendance is in general important, being present throughout an immersive experience is critical for success. Consider a standard three-credit college course. This is usually associated with three hours in class per week over a period of a semester... so about 40 hours in class. The Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly is a 480-hour course, or equivalent to about twelve college classes. This doesn't take into account the nights and weekends you'll likely spend on coursework. In order to successfully make it through this course, being late or absent considerably affects your ability to keep up with the class.

- Students are allowed up to 3 excused absences over the course.
- 3 tardies or 3 early departures = 1 absence.
- Students who are absent are responsible for connecting with their instructional team to catch up on what they missed.

### Satisfactorily complete 80% of all homework.

Homework is a broad category that is a combination of labs and blog posts

- Labs will be the most common method of evaluation - there will be approximately two to three labs each week. It is our expectation that you complete each lab to the best of your ability. We will grade all labs and labs will be graded pass/fail.
- Blog posts are a way for you to share your experiences, to get noticed, and to communicate your understanding of data science to the world. The most successful data scientists have and regularly publish on blogs. Many data scientists have blogs as a way to communicate interesting findings, code snippets that they have found to be particularly helpful or challenging, and discussions of "hot" data science topics. You are expected to complete six data science-related blog posts by the date of graduation.

You must complete 80% of all assigned labs, blog posts, and assessments in order to graduate.

### Satisfactorily complete all projects.

You'll hear more details about these later, but you'll complete a series of projects designed to demonstrate mastery of the entire data science "pipeline" - from data collection to exploratory data analysis to modeling to writing up and presenting results. The requirements for each project will vary and be specified when each project is announced. Projects tend to be the most time-consuming component of the course, so it is always advised that you start early! You may resubmit a maximum of one project.

# Asking for Help

Outside of one-on-ones, you can always ask me any question during the day. But before you ask, make sure you've run through:

1. Try something else
2. Google
3. StackOverflow
4. Ask another classmate

If I get the impression that you haven't tried the first four steps, I might push back and redirect you to Google, an article, or lesson content. It's not that I want to be mean, it's because asking me programming questions isn't a sustainable approach to learning programming!

If it's clear that you've made a concerted effort to research the problem, then I'd be more than happy to help you figure things out. Usually the first question I'll ask is "What errors are you getting?"

If your question is non-technical—you're feeling overwhelmed, or you have questions about a homework or project prompt—I'll do my best to address your concerns as quickly and thoroughly as possible.

Just a heads up: I don't really check Slack past 6:00pm. This is for my work-life balance as well as yours!

# Plagiarism

TL;DR: don't plagiarize...
